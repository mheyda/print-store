# Photography Ecommerce Application

## Technologies Used
<ul>
    <li>React</li>
    <li>Redux</li>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
</ul>

## Overview
As a hobbyist photographer, I wanted to practice my frontend engineering skills by developing a simple and fully responsive ecommerce app from scratch for photography prints. The project was originally built with plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, but was later converted into a 
React and Redux application for better organization and maintainability.

## Functionality
The app provides users a full shopping experience, allowing them to adjust their cart at every step along the way. Primary functionality 
is listed below.
<ul>
    <li>Pull product data from a local JSON file and populate the 'shop' tab</li>
    <li>Allow users to view a more detailed page for each product</li>
    <li>Image carousel to allow users to view all images for a specific product</li>
    <li>Image modal for users to view images full-screen</li>
    <li>Add items to cart</li>
    <li>Update cart items</li>
    <li>Remove items from cart</li>
</ul>

## Project Challenges
The biggest challenge with this project was organization. This site was originally built with plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, so keeping 
the code readable and organized was difficult. Although it worked, the code was not maintainable. As I progressed in my studies and learned 
React and Redux, I decided to convert the project into a React app, which is what you find here. This allowed me to keep my code organized 
better for future maintenance and updates.
